# Aloha
This is the Aloha project. My first project of the web development program at RED Academy. It is a basic website containing just html
and css. With it I learned and used things such as floats, text styles, display, custom fonts, gradiants, and so much more. With it
being my first project for web development it was pretty tough, there was much trial and error and lots of googleing but in the end I have
a product im proud of.
